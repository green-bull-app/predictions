# Green Bull Predictions Intro :crystal_ball:

Green Bull Predictions is a simple decentralised prediction market. It allows users to earn stable-coins by predicting the near future market

## How does it work?

It pretty simple. Once your wallet is connected, simply predict if the price of BTC/USDT will be higher or lower than it was when the LIVE phase started. If you enter an UP position, and the BTC/USDT “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 5 minute LIVE phase, you win! And if it’s lower, you lose.
